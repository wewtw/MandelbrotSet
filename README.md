# MandelbrotSet

<p>Have fun exploring this updated version of MandelbrotSet its much better than the older version I had and one of the best I've seen.
The slower you zoom in the better it will go. The zoom in navigates to the mouse pointer.</p>

<p>To add more details to the set go to maxIterations = 100 and make the number bigger. This will make it slower to load because calculations are being made with every iteration.</p>
<p>To change colors go to const colors = [] and edit the array as needed. </p>
